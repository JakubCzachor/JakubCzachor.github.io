<h2>Project: Water Quality in NYC</h2><br>
  <h3>Abstract: </h3><br>
  My project will be looking at the water quality of NYC especially as the source of the water has changed recently as a result of the closure of the Catskill Aqueduct, <br> 
  and how this can be used to make informed decisions on if the water quality in NYC needs further treatment when such closures happen.
